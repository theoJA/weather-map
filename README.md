# City Map and Weather
An app that allows the user to search for a city and returns the map and the average weather for the next 30 days.
Can be useful for planning future travels since the searched cities are all shown as a list.

### Future Plans
The app's UI could certainly be improved and more labels should be added to the weather portion of the app. Allowing users to drag and rearrange cities could also be useful.

### To run: 
- Clone repo and cd to project directory
- yarn install / npm install
- yarn start / npm run start
- 'localhost:8080' on the browser
